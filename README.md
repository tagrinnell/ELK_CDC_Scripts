# ELK_CDC_Scripts
A few scripts for installing ELK for CDC and such

Quick Guide:

Use getelastic.sh for getting a simple wget for the archived ElasticSearch .tar.gz files

Register passes an enroll token (Can't copy-paste on CDC Boxes)

On master Node, need to have the following settings configured:
`
cluster.name: <name>       # Needs to be the same on all of the machines \
node.name: <name>          # Machine Specific \
node.roles: [master, data] # unsure if this should be something else
transport.host: 0.0.0.0    # Uncomment on master to allow other nodes to connect
network.host: <IP>         # Exposes Elasticsearch on a port
`

Also perform as root: `sysctl -w vm.max_map_count` (All boxes)

After launching, need to create enrollment tokens to enroll (Recommend saving to a file to concatenate to end of register file):

`/elasticsearch-x.x.x/bin/elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token -s node`

On other nodes, only need to configure cluster.name, node.name.

If running the register script results in a default security error, then the node is in the cluster, only need to execute elasticsearch.
